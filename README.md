# font-ligatures-examples

From a font file, generate a string array of ligatures.

## Why?

If you're creating design systems, you may have a component specifically for rendering icons, and that component may depend on a font file that uses ligatures to display icons.

You may want to create a TypeScript interface of the union of all possible ligatures for your font, providing intelliense and a generally superior developer experience to the consumers of your design system.
